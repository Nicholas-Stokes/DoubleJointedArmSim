This simulation is based on the WPILib `ArmSimulation` example which is an implementation of `SingleJointedArmSim`. We on 3467 are using this to help demystify some of the control challenges associated with this type of robot:

To run, start the simulation mode, open Glass, and once the robot is enabled, update the SmartDashboard setpoints for bottom and top arm angle to see how the arm responds. 

## Motorized wrist (triple jointed arm) support - beta

Beta for wrist support is available for testing on the `double-with-wrist` branch.
